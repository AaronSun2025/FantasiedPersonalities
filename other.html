  <div class="starting-info">
    <p>This personality test is based on the Myers-Briggs type indicator, where it asks 4 questions with 2 answers each.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Are you outwardly or inwardly focused?(Extroversion(E) or Introversion(I))</li>
      <li>How do you prefer to take in information?(Sensing(S) or Intuition(N))</li>
      <li>How do you prefer to make decisions?(Thinking(T) or Feeling(F)</li>
      <li>How do you prefer to live your outer life?(Judging(J) or Perceiving(P))</li>
    </ol><br><br><br>

    <p>There are a total of 16 personality types using this method, after you take the test a submit button will give you the answer, then you can come over to this page and check what you got. The Examples(Famous People/Characters) and my version of fantasy assignments could seem far-fetched, but my version embodies what I think that personality represents as a whole, and there are variations to each personality as well.</p><br>
