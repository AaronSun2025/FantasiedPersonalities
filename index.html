      This website is an attempt of a personality test, where your answer will correlate you to a fantasy character like for example a knight or a king. The algorithm for this website will not be accurate, and you might disagree with the results. The purpose of this website is not to tell you what your absolute personality is, it's a test to see what you might get when talking about fantasied characters, if you agree with your result great, but the general purpose is for you to try this version of a personality test, and to have fun.
